					<button class="toggleButton19">19th Century</button>
					<p class="19thcentury">
						On 1 January 1801, the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain were
						merged to create a United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
					</p>
					<p class="19thcentury">
						The act of union removed the Irish parliament and located all matters of
						governance to Westminister in London England
					</p>
					<p class="19thcentury">
						The UK seen Ireland as a source of Agricultural produce and so Ireland largely
						missed the industrial revolution of the 19th century
					</p>
					<p class="19thcentury">
						The Great Famine (1845 - 1851) saw Irelands population of approximately 8.2
						million people reduce by a third
					</p>
					<p class="19thcentury">
						The Great Famine along with a revival of Irish Nationalism through organisations
						such as the Gaelic Athletic Association saw a shift towards Irish independence in the late 19th
						Century
						beginning under Daniel O Connell progressing with Charles Stewart Parnell but ultimately
						ending in diplomatic failure. The 20th Century would prove to be a new dawn for Ireland
					</p>

					<button class="toggleButton20">20th Century</button>
					<p class="20thcentury">
						1914 saw Ireland finally achieve "Home Rule" and achieve limited autonomy from
						the United Kingdom. World War 1 led to the suspension of Home Rule for Ireland until the
						cessation of hostilities
					</p>
					<p class="20thcentury">
						Easter 1916 saw a group of Irish revolutionary leaders known as the Irish
						Republican brotherhood led an armed uprising against the rule of the United Kingdom.
						The rebels seized control of strategic areas of Dublin (Irelands capital). They were
						defeated swiftly by the crown forces and the leaders of the uprising were execeuted.
						Public support for the rising was low. However the execeution of the revolutionary
						leaders did not go down well with the public. Public support turned in favor of the
						rebels when news broke that the revolutionary leader James Connolly was shot in his
						wheelchair
					</p>
					<p class="20thcentury">
						Following the rising a young Cork man by the name of Michael Collins redefined
						the strategy for achieving Irelands liberty. Collins firmly believed that large scale
						engagements such as the Easter rising would only lead to further defeats. Collins
						preferred Guerilla Warfare coupled with counter intelligence</p>
					<p class="20thcentury">
						From 1919 Irish Republican Army (IRA), launched a three-year guerrilla war,
						which ended in a truce in July 1921
					</p>
					<p class="20thcentury">
						Collins led a delegation to London which ultimately agreed to the partition of
						Ireland in the 26 county Free State and the 6 counties of Northern Ireland
					</p>

					<button class="toggleButton21">21st Century</button>

						March 2004 Ireland becomes the first country in the world to introduce a workplace smoking ban

						May 2015 Ireland becomes the first country in the world to legalise marriage for gay couples
						through popular vote

						1,038 m above sea level. The most arable land lies in the province of Leinster. Western areas
						can be mountainous and rocky with green panoramic vistas. River Shannon, the island's longest
						river at 386 km long, rises in County Cavan in the north west and flows through Limerick in the
						mid west.</p>
