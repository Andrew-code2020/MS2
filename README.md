# Holiday in Ireland Destination

The Holiday in Ireland website is designed to people at home in Ireland and abroad find four types of holiday;

1. Activity 
2. Culture
3. Wellness
4. City Breaks. 

The problem that we are trying to solve is that current holiday websites in Ireland offer too many types of holidays. We want to slim the offer down and focus
on these four strategically valuable markets. We have designed the website to offer quick links to the best quality holidays in these four areas. The success
of this website is that the user is able to locate the holiday they want quickly and easily without having to sift through the large amounts of offers on other sites.  

### UX

The key reasons for producing the website were to;

- help potential visitors learn about Ireland as a holiday destination
- help new potential visitors learn easily about the type of holidays that are available in Ireland
- help new potential users connect and communicate easily with someone who will help them make a holiday booking in Ireland
- help new potential users easily follow Ireland on various Social Media accounts
- help the Ireland attract tourists

At the outset the minimum viable product was determined to be a communication platform between the operator(s) of the Holiday in Ireland website and a source for basic information about holidays in Ireland at the best tourist destinations.
It was an objective of this project to include an intuitive design which would allow new potential clients to navigate and enagage with the website without any prior experience of Ireland as a tourist destination. 
Current and potential client surveys were conducted to assess the minumim effective information required to illicit a positive emotional response from users.
This information was incredibly valuable during the construction of wireframes for the website. 
At the outset conventional web design features were favoured because we wanted everyone from the novice to accompolished web user to feel like they were still in a familiar place on the web. 
The vision for the project was to have a website that displayed basic information on Irelands top tourist destination with quick options to open a communication channel with the Holiday in Ireland team to help the user make a booking. 
Further objectives included;
- implementing interactive features on the web site to help the user feel in touch with Ireland
- allow the user to locate holiday areas in Ireland
- allow the user to learn some basic information about Ireland

#### Appearance differences on other devices

- On small mobile devices such as phones the navbar will collapse into a black cog wheel icon.
- The programming of the website allows it to adjust column widths on smaller devices and stack elements in a display to fit different browsers mentioned earlier and different devices mentioned earlier. The most obvious examples are the navbar which becomes a drop down menu and stacks on top of itself and the footer which stacks on top of itself and allows the user to scroll down. 
- The Project was built with mobile first design principles

#### Bugs

- Galaxy 5S Jumbotron seems to overlay on top of the footer. Despite my best efforts I was unable to solve this.
- Fixed Top overlaying my alert bar. During develpment I played around with a fixed top. At first the Alert Bar would disappear behind the Navbar. Then as I corrected the code the alert bar came in on top of the navbar but this would then overlay onto the section of each page. I used padding and height settings to solve this problem but I also changed the Navbar to a sticky-top. I am unsure whether the sticky-top class changed things very much. I did a lot of refining with heights and padding to get the website to render the way it is now.
- Fixed Bottom I deployed a fixed bottom for the footer early in the development process. Unfortunately this overlayed  in the section element of each page. I was unable to resolve this using height, padding and overflow css properties and values.
- On the learn about Ireland page when you hover the cursor over the card and then toggle any of the buttons you will notice that unless you toggle the same button to "close" the content before moving onto the next button will simple add it's content underneath. This is a bug that needs to be resolved in future development. 
- On the learn about Ireland page the history photo on the card flip had to be rotated to this photo because the other others stretched and I could not reolve this stretch despite deploying css selector, properties and values to try and manipulate the image.
- On the explore Ireland page you will find the code for the Google Maps API is written with the HTML below the footer. I acknowledge that this is bad practise but I was unable to get the map to render unless the code was in HTML page. I researched a reason why but I could not find one that I can understand. I will need to keep looking for answers with this feature to better refine my code.
- On the contact us pages the html code validator pointed out that the id = "gridRadios1" must be unique. I tried swapping the id gridRadios1 with gridRadios2 and adding the appropriate code in the sendEmail.js file but this would not lead to the correct information being transmitted through email JS.

    - Footer
    - Section
    - Navbar
    - Alert Bar
    - Form
    - Dropdown menu
    - Buttons

- Google Fonts I imported the text font Recursive from Google Fonts website https://fonts.google.com/

- I copied the hero image idea in a similar way to the Jumbtron idea from our code along whiskey drop project with the code institute. I used Boostrap to copy the code and then modified it to fit the style of this project. Reference to Github repository from code along project https://andrew-code2020.github.io/whiskeydrop/

- I copied the icons from Font awesome https://fontawesome.com/ and used the CDN to implement them in the project. I then wrote custom code to style the icons and make them more responsive. The icon next to the code institute is not the true code institute icon it is a freely available icon in font awesome.

- I copied the card flip code from W3schools.com https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_flip_card.asp. I then customised it's functionality in my project.

- I copied the toggle, show and hide, mouseenter, mouseleave code from jQuery https://jquery.com/. I reviewed the lessons on jQuery in the Interactive Front Development Module to help me implement the features in this project. 

- I copied the footer design from https://dermomurphy.github.io/Dublin-360-CI/index.html and then customised it to fit my project.

- I frequently referred back to the following code institute modules to research how to construct certain features

  - HTML Fundamentals
  - CSS Fundamentals
  - User Centric Front End Development
  - JavaScript Fundamentals
  - Interactive Front End Development

- I copied the Bootstrap CDN and Font awesome CDN links from my previous milestone project
- I copied the idea of the class custom navbar from  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/. This did not make the final project cut but never the less helped me shape my understanding of the navbar from bootstrap. 

- I copied the majority of the information available in the sections below from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland
  - History (Heading)
    - 19th Century (Button)
    - 20th Century (Button)
    - 21st Century (Button)
